# Music Venues App-Project 1

## Objective
Our goal was to create a CRUD app to locate and build a directory of local SF/East Bay music venues. People that are new to the city often need word-of-mouth reference or a comprehensive guide to break through the mainstream, which is where our app comes into place!
The main focus/inspiration stemmed from the fact that "big room" venues (think Civic Center, SFJazz, etc) are the most-frequented and well-known, but there are unique atmospheres, amenities, and artists that can only be found at smaller neighborhood venues.
Smaller venues also provide more flexibility and spontaneity for artists in some circumstances which
allow for more engaging, unique performances.

## Technologies Used
The front end is comprised of:
JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, HTML, CSS, SCSS, and built on the Foundation framework (css+sass).

Back end is comprised of:
Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose.

We needed to install Compass as the SASS pre-compiler to get Foundation up and running, but we did not
put emphasis on utilizing the scss files. The main challenge was getting all of the new dependencies
set up correctly and dealing with the inherited styling patterns when aiming to modify
specific elements.
